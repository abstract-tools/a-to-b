`npm install foreword`

## Why Foreword?

- Ability to partially apply all functions, allowing you to write smaller, cleaner code.
- Restrict functions to one type of data.
- Leverage type separation into a more interesting interface, such as [A.map](#array-map) and [O.map](#object-map).
- Provide useful functions for handling unwanted values.
- Ensure correctness of transformations, not allowing references to be mutated.

A benefit of this approach is that `foreword` will have no trouble adding functions for new types in the future, like `Map` or `Set`.
